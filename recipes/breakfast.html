        <h3>What is scrambled eggs?</h3>

        <p>
            Scrambled eggs are one of the little luxuries of everyday life. They are one of many variations of cook/fried eggs. When I make them, I savor every bite. They’re soft and creamy, rich and flavorful, and they just so happen to cook in under 5 minutes.
            When it comes to scrambled eggs, “best” is a matter of personal taste. You can load them up with butter or sour cream, or just keep them simple.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggs, of course! Use the freshest ones you can find, from a local source if possible</li>
                <li>Milk, plant milk, or water – I whisk a little into the eggs before I cook them. This additional moisture makes the eggs extra-soft and creamy.</li>
                <li>Extra-virgin olive oil or butter, for the pan. I always use olive oil because it’s what I keep handy. But butter works well too.</li>
                <li>Salt.</li>
                <li>And pepper! To add depth of flavor to these simple scrambled eggs.</li>
            </ul>
