        <h3>What is scrambled eggs?</h3>

        <p>
            Scrambled eggs are one of the little luxuries of everyday life. They are one of many variations of cook/fried eggs. When I make them, I savor every bite. They’re soft and creamy, rich and flavorful, and they just so happen to cook in under 5 minutes.
            When it comes to scrambled eggs, “best” is a matter of personal taste. You can load them up with butter or sour cream, or just keep them simple.
