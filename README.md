# African-recipes
An African recipe  website. 

A beginner project.

This is an African recipes website. You will find recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a typical Nigerian household. 
 
By the end of this project I would have demonstrated the use of html to give structure and content to the web pages and css for styling and layout.
